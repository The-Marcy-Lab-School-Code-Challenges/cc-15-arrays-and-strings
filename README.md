# Code Challenge: Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Declare a function named `findLongestWord`, that takes an array of strings as an argument, and returns the longest string in the array. If there is more than one longest word, the function should return the first longest string that appears in the array. You must solve this without using any array methods. 
```
findLongestWord(["The","quick","brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]) //returns "jumped"

findLongestWord(["jazzy", "jumpy", "quaky") //returns "jazzy"
```
